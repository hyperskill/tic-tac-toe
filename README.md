# Tic-Tac-Toe

Project: Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

Go to the *src* directory, change *Main.java* and put your *.java* file(s) in it.

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
